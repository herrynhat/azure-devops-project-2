# Overview Of Udacity Azure Project 2

Hello, I am Nhat, this is project 2 has been created during the Nanodegree for DevOps Engineer using MS Azure on Udacity.

This project consists of flask application that is developed to predict housing prices in Boston (the model is already created by the instructor).
After planning the different steps regarding the deployment of a Python Flask Machine Learning app, we will manage to add GitHub Actions and Azure Pipeline to it to have a fully working CI/CD environment. 

This repositry demonstrate:
- Deploying the app in Azure CloudShell
- Deploying the app as a web server using Azure App Service.

If anything changed in it repository,  it will trigger the Github Action and also the Azure DevOps Pipelines to perform the CICD process and finally deploy to my app service.
